Burger Burner is a remake of an old game I made when I was young. The goal of
the game is to avoid the fires for as long as possible.

In the original game, you could extinguish the constantly-amassing fires by
shooting fireballs or squirting water. Every 30 seconds of play, a boss would
also appear, complicating your fire-extinguishing efforts!

So far, my best-score is 3764! Can you beat that?

## Design goals

The goal of this project was to learn how to make HTML5 games. After some
research, I decided on using the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) framework to
produce a browser-ready game. Although there is still much more to add to Burger
Burner, I can definitely say that I achieved this goal!

Additional features that I would like to add:
- Weapons (fireballs, water gun)
- Boss enemies
- Additional game modes
- Original artwork, sprites, and sound
- Intro cut-scene to add a bit of story!
- Rogue-lite features like purchasing upgrades between runs
- Additional levels that have different challenges
